###Banco Digital Dio - Santander Bootcamp. Developed for Studies referring to the Java language. Object Oriented Penter code hererogramming and other concepts
Challenge: Considering our knowledge in the banking domain, we will abstract an Object Oriented solution in Java. To do this, we will interpret the following scenario: “A bank offers its customers two types of accounts (current and savings), which have the functionality of deposit, withdrawal and transfer (between the institution’s own accounts).”

#Abstraction
Ability to focus on essential aspects of a domain, ignoring less important or accidental features. In this context, objects are abstractions of existing entities in the domain in question.

#encapsulation
Encapsulating means hiding the implementation of objects, thus creating more concise and easier to use/understand user interfaces. Encapsulation mainly favors two aspects of a system: maintenance and evolution.

#Heritage
Allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called a derived class.

#````Polymorphism
The ability of an object to be referenced in various ways, that is, the ability to treat objects created from specific classes as objects of a generic class. Be careful, polymorphism does not mean that the object keeps changing, on the contrary, an object is born of a type and dies of that type, what can change is the way we refer to it.
